First, I would like to highlight three contributions to the education
communities in mathematics, statistics, and data science.

### USCOTS 2021 Planning Committee

As discussed in a [section on criterion 2]({{<ref
"/criterion2/workshops.md">}}), I have conducted several workshops on
teaching data science, two of which part of the United States Conference on
Teaching Statistics (USCOTS). This year, likely due to these workshops, the
co-chairs of USCOTS 2021 invited me to serve on the planning
committee--co-chairing the pre-conference workshop's planning. Planning this
year's conference has been a challenge--it is virtual--and I am excited to
serve in this capacity, as USCOTS has had a significant impact on my career.

### Data Visualization in Python, SDSS 2019, Belleview, WA

{{< figure src="/img/invited.png" title=" **Figure 1**: I organized and chaired an invited session for SDSS 2019 that brought in experts to teach the audience about data visualizations in Python.">}}

At the request of Dr. Silas Bergen, I organized an invited session for the
2019 Symposium on Data Science & Statistics (SDSS 2019) that focused on
inducing the audience to data visualization in Python. The first speaker,
Stephen Elston from Quantia Analytic, introduced the audience to the
MatPlotLib and the Seaborn libraries. Mr. Elston designed to provide easy
access to standard statistical visualizations. Dominik Moritz from the
University of Washington and Kanit "Ham" Wongsuphasawat from Apple designed
the next two talks, which focused on Altair, a visualization framework that

1. Is based on the Grammar of Graphics.
2. Allows hosting visualization on sites such as GitHub.
3. Is built on the Vega and Vega-Lite frameworks.

### A Course on Teaching Data Science, Project Next, 2020

{{< figure src="/img/project_next.png" title=" **Figure 2**: Chris Malone and I developed and taught a Project NExT short course on teaching data science.">}}

Shortly after earning a Ph.D., I participated in Project NExT, a professional
development program for new/recent Ph.D.s. This program had a significant
impact on my career, and this year I had the opportunity to give back. Dr.
Chris Malone and I taught a short course on teaching data science described
below.

> The curriculum for an introductory data science course varies tremendously as
> the definition of data science depends on oneâ€™s perspective. This workshop
> will discuss how the curriculum for our introductory data science course has
> changed so that students who have a diverse background in computing can
> succeed. Best practices, including specific examples, for the teaching of an
> introductory data science course will be presented.
