In the area of service to Winona State University, I have served on several
departmental and university faculty committees, most recently taking on the
role of co-chair of CPPS. In this section, I will highlight three specific
areas of service and then give an overview of other activities related to
this criterion.

## Co-chairing Course and Program Proposal Subcommittee (CPPS) 

This year I am serving as co-chair of the Course Program Proposal
Subcommittee (CPPS). This semester the committee has approved seven new
courses, three revised courses, and nine program revisions. I have been
working with the Curriculog Work Group on improving the process of proposing
changes to courses and programs.

I asked Craig Upright, chair of Academic Affairs and Curriculum Committee, to speak to my service as co-chair of CPPS this year.  Here is some of what he had to say in his [email of support](/testimonial/upright_CPPS_email.pdf/).

> I want to extend my thanks to you (and to Jason Kight) for co-chairing CPPS
> this year. This committee plays such a vital role in our faculty curriculum
> committee review process, and I think it is one of the most important in
> terms of the impact it plays on our undergraduate catalog. From my own
> experience as a committee member, I know that addressing some of the fine
> details of new and revised course proposals can be time-consuming and
> occasionally draining, but this level of attention has a tremendous positive
> impact on how both instructors and students will approach these courses when
> they are finally offered.
> 
> As a former CPPS chair, I also have a deep appreciation for the work you must
> do in order to keep everything flowing smoothly. From my perspective as the
> current A2C2 chair, you are doing an outstanding job. You have maintained
> good communication with your committee members, the proposal originators, and
> our Warrior Hub team in order to ensure that these proposals get implemented
> in the way best meets the needs of our faculty and students. And, perhaps
> more importantly, you have helped reinforce the role of your committee as a
> faculty resource as opposed to one with a gatekeeping approach.
> 
> Finally, I want to thank you for your active participation in our A2C2
> meetings this year. We have had to deal with several challenging issues, and
> I have been impressed by your advocacy and your insights as we have discussed
> some important policy changes and considered their wider implications. You
> have presented your views with both passion and respect. I have no doubt you
> will continue to make strong contributions to our faculty governance in the
> years to come.

## Implement the Prediction Accuracy Portion of MUDAC 2017

{{< figure src="/img/kaggle.png" title=" **Figure 1**: In 2017 and 2018, I organized the data analytics portion of the MUDAC competition, where Kaggle was used validate the models and to track the leaderboard in real-time.">}}

In preparation for the 2017 MUDAC competition, the statistics and data
science faculty decided to include a new competition component. The general
sentiment was that, in past years, scores too heavily favored a team’s
presentation skills and didn't account for groups that had more advanced
analytics skills did not get the recognition we believed they deserved.

To facilitate this new part of the competition, I took on the responsibility
for the implementation and operation of two competitions using Kaggle. First,
I constructed a preliminary completion using a well-known data set to allow
participants to become familiar with the Kaggle framework. I gave teams a
week to play around with these data and asked them to make at least one
successful submission before the start of the competition. The results of
this preliminary competition had no impact on the actual competition.

We used the second Kaggle competition to evaluate each team’s performance for
the actual prediction problem. Teams could make submissions throughout the
competition and track their (approximate) performance on a public
leaderboard. We determined the final results using a private leaderboard that
was unavailable after the contest closed.

The analytics portion of the competition was very successful, and the MUDAC
competition has been using this framework ever since (at least until the
pandemic).

## Update the Program Objectives for the Data Science Program

Based on my prior experience with program assessment, I was excited to
contribute to the statistics and data science programs' program assessment.
We took the first step in this direction this year by formalizing the program
outcomes for the data science program. Dr. Chris Malone and I met several
times to consider these outcomes, using recommendations made from various
sources and attempted to align the topics and sections to those found in the
ASA recommendations for a statistics major. This initial draft was the basis
for the program outcomes that were approved by the subgroup and department.

## An Overview of Other Service Activities

While the items above represent the most substantial work in this area, 
here is a list of other activities in the area of service.

In the last four years, I have served on

1. the Statistics Subcommittee each year, taking a leadership role in
   1. Revising the internship application and assessment materials.
   2. Revising the oral and written communication courses in both the statistics and data science majors.
   3. Supporting a 5-year program review for both the data science and statistics programs.
   4. Helped revamp the general education assessment materials for STAT 110.
   5. Served on the planning committee for MUDAC 2017 and MUDAC 2018
2. the CPPS committee as a regular member for one year. 
3. three search committees, one for a tenure-track position and the others for fixed-term positions.
4. the SLAC subcommittee for two years, helping organize departmental seminars and outside speakers.
5. the General Education Program and Policies (GEPS) committee for one semester.
6. the WSU FA Technology and Online Education Committees one year each.
