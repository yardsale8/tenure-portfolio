The final set of activities promoting student growth and development I will
highlight are all related to advising, which is not limited to academic
advising, but also includes serving as an adviser for capstone
experiences--be it research projects or internships.

###  Academic Advising

Over the last four and a half years, I now have advised 34 students with data
science majors or minors. Students in our department are initially assigned
an advisor in their first year, and I have twice taken on all incoming majors
for that academic year. Students then have the option of selecting their
advisor moving forward. While some of my more experienced colleagues have
likely advised more students over the same period, I believe that I have
completed a decent share of the overall workload.

### Supervising of Student-based Research 

Over the last few years, I had the opportunity to advise several students on
their capstone projects, each of which are summarized below.

**Investigating Python Using Housing Data.** Catherine Nead was interested in
a capstone project that involved working with Python, developed a project
that involved using Python to automate the acquisition and processing of data
from Zillow through the use of an API. Catherine used the resulting data to
build and test predictive models for predicting a home sale price using
information from comparable houses. The result was a project that was novel
in several ways:

1. The API returned data in the JSON format, which required Catherine to learn about this data type and the Python toolset.
2. The data included information on each house of interest and data on comparable homes, which required careful feature selection and aggregation.
3. Catherine had no prior experience with Python.

Catherine presented her work as a poster at the Ramaley Research Celebration.

**Predicting Unemployment in Barcelona.** Jackie Sieve is a dual Spanish and
DSCI major and wanted to find a data science project related to her second
major. She studied unemployment in Barcelona during the 2008 recession by
extracting features and building models to predict each neighborhood's
unemployment numbers. Her resulting models did a fantastic job predicting
unemployment, with the best models having an r-squared of around 99.7%.

**Data Verbs for SQL.** YingZhang (Daniel) Lew worked with me developing
Python tools that allow the application of data verbs to SQL databases in
Python. I went into more detail on these ideas in last yearâ€™s PDR. Daniel
developed many tools independently while learning about essential software
engineering techniques and writing proper documentation, continual
development, and automated unit tests.

While it is too early to give details, I am currently supervising three more
student capstone research projects over this year.

### Supervising of Internships

I have also served as faculty supervisor for seven previous or on-going
internships. While advising an internship isn't as involved as advising
research projects, it does require ensuring that the job description meets
the needs of STAT/DSCI 488, obtaining self and supervisor assessments of
performance, and translating those assessments into a final grade. Based on
my experiences with the first few internships, I have improved the student
experience by helping formalizes the application and requirements and
developing Qualtrics surveys used for self and supervisor performance
evaluations.
